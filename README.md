Residential Housing Price Prediction
 This project simulates the role of a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). The goal is to analyze and predict residential housing prices based on various property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more.

The repository contains a structured Jupyter Notebook with ten key questions guiding the analysis, including data exploration, visualization, feature analysis, and predictive modeling. Users can view the final outputs, including charts, tables, and model results.

This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling for real estate investment decisions.
